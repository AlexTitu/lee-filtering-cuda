# Implementation of a Lee Filter for speckle noise on CUDA and CPU
Speckle noise is prevalent in Sentinel 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imagery.<br /> 
This project aims at using GPU accelerated libraries Numba and CuPY for implementing the Lee Filter while also comparing the CPU implementation using NumPY.<br />
All results are presented in the PDF found in the folder.<br />
